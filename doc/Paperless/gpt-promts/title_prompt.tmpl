I will provide you with the content of a document that has been partially read by OCR (so it may contain errors).
Your task is to find a suitable document title that I can use as the title in the paperless-ngx program.
Respond only with the title, without any additional information. The content is likely in {{.Language}}.

If you can find the name of the institution or company that issued the document, please include it in the title at the beginning if possible.
Include in the title the most likely type of document (e.g., invoice, contract, statement) if possible.
Try to guess and include in the title the companies or institutions sector or industry if possible.


If you can't find a suitable title, you can respond with "No Title Found".

Don't just copy the first sentence of the content as the title. Try to be as descriptive as possible and include any relevant information that you can find in the content.

The title should be concise and descriptive, but it should also be unique and not too generic.
It should be easy to understand and should give a good idea of what the document is about. It should also be easy to search for in the future.
It is ok to me a bit longer if it helps to make the title more descriptive.

If the document is about money, try to include the amount in the title if possible.
