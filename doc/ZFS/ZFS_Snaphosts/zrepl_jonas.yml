# This config serves as an example for a local zrepl installation that
# backups the entire zpool `system` to `backuppool/zrepl/sink`
#
# The requirements covered by this setup are described in the zrepl documentation's
# quick start section which inlines this example.
#
# CUSTOMIZATIONS YOU WILL LIKELY WANT TO APPLY:
# - adjust the name of the production pool `system` in the `filesystems` filter of jobs `snapjob` and `push_to_drive`
# - adjust the name of the backup pool `backuppool` in the `backuppool_sink` job
# - adjust the occurences of `myhostname` to the name of the system you are backing up (cannot be easily changed once you start replicating)
# - make sure the `zrepl_` prefix is not being used by any other zfs tools you might have installed (it likely isn't)

jobs:

# this job takes care of snapshot creation + pruning
- name: snapjob
  type: snap
  filesystems: {
    "tank1<": true,
    "tank0<": true,
    # Exclude the media directory from backups
    "tank0/encrypted/media<": false
  }
  # create snapshots with prefix `zrepl_` every 15 minutes
  snapshotting:
    type: periodic
    interval: 15m
    prefix: zrepl_
  pruning:
    keep:
  # fade-out scheme for snapshots starting with `zrepl_`
  # - keep all created in the last hour
  # - then destroy snapshots such that we keep 24 each 1 hour apart
  # - then destroy snapshots such that we keep 14 each 1 day apart
  # - then destroy all older snapshots
    - type: grid
      grid: 1x1h(keep=all) | 24x1h | 35x1d | 6x30d
      regex: "^zrepl_.*"
  # keep all snapshots that don't have the `zrepl_` prefix
    - type: regex
      negate: true
      regex: "^zrepl_.*"
